This site is about an educational consult with an online learning platform where lectures can be held and recorded

The public resource section of the website is where the entire books are shared and students or subscribers can easily sign in, look for a certain book and read

Tutors or lecturers can also record a class, upload it to the site and attach books to it, provided the book has been uploaded too and is in the public resource section
